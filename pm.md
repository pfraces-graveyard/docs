# project management

A project starts as a [draft][1], an easy way of declaring intentions: chaotic
brainstormed docuemntation

When some draft gets the insterest to be developed the following steps must be
done:

1.  Create a repo under [pfraces][2] personal github account
2.  Refactor the draft to be a `README.md` with examples
3.  Create unit tests with the api showed in the previous examples

When the project obtains an usable version, publish it transfering its
ownership to one of the following github organizations
