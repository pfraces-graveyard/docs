# project management

A project starts as a [draft][1], an easy way of declaring intentions: chaotic brainstormed docuemntation

When some draft gets the insterest to be developed the following steps must be
done:

1.  Create a repo under [pfraces][2] personal github account
2.  Refactor the draft to be a `README.md` with examples
3.  Create unit tests with the api showed in the `README.md` examples

When the project obtains an usable version, publish it transfering its
ownership to one of the following github organizations
